Getting started

This site should have no issues running on any web browser. The only issue that it will have right now is accomodating to different screen sizes since the elements are in absolute formatting. This is something that will be continually updated over time.


Pair programming

As of 2/10/19 Trey Herndon is the only person to have worked on these files. Updates by date will be put below this line for a full historical account of who was working in this code base and what they did to it.
